Implement Etch-a-Sketch project 
# Etch-A-Sketch

## Description
This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

## Features
- 16x16 drawing grid dynamically created with JavaScript
- Hover effect allowing "drawing" by moving the mouse over the cells
- Button to reset the grid and choose a new size (max 100x100)
- Use of Flexbox for grid display

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Technical Challenges
- Dynamic creation of DOM elements
- Handling mouse events
- Manipulation of CSS styles via JavaScript
- Use of `prompt` for user interaction

## Bonus Features
- Random colors: Each interaction produces a random RGB color
- Progressive darkening effect: Each mouse pass darkens the cell by 10%

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Move your mouse over the grid to draw
3. Click the button at the top to change the grid size

## Learnings
This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Programming logic
- Responsive design with Flexbox

## Future Improvements
- Add a selectable color palette
- Implement a function to save and share drawings
- Optimize performance for large grid sizes

Feel free to fork this project and propose your own improvements!
